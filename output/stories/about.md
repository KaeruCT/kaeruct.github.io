I'm a software developer, GNU / Linux geek, and free software enthusiast.

This is my personal blog. I try to post things relevant to programming, but
sometimes I might post about something else, such as music, videogames, or myself.

This is an effort to produce some content, since I read a lot of things on the Internet
daily, but I almost never write any content of my own. On the other hand, I code
a lot of random stuff and I always make sure it is available online, so I guess
that kind of thing balances it out.

However, I would like to make some technical posts
about my favorite technologies, which is why I made this blog in the first place.
I haven't been able to come up with anything useful yet, but I will post it
as soon as I do.
