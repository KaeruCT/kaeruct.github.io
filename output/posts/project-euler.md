I started doing the [Project Euler problems](http://projecteuler.net/)
last weekend. So far managed to get to problem 10.

I have realized how much I suck at math, and now I want to learn more.
I know people with knowledge in math will probably laugh at my solutions,
I really feel like I half-assed most of them so far.

Those with knowledge in math will probably find the problems easier than
those with knowledge only in programming... Being good at math makes you
a better programmer.

Did I mention I'm trying to program the solution to each problem in a
different programming language? Last one I used was pascal. Never had used
it before. It's a horrible language, I'm glad I don't have to use it ever
again for anything.

By the way, every time I solve a problem I will updated my github repo.

to critique!
