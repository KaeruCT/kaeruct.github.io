Yesterday after work I had some time to waste, so I decided to do some
silly things in javascript with a canvas and some trigonometric magic.

[Here are some screenshots of what they look like](/galleries/rainbow).

Move your mouse around to change some variables, and click to toggle clearing of
the canvas. You can achieve some trippy effects!

- [colorful flower](/projects/flower)

These are all on my github, in case you wanna [take a look](https://github.com/KaeruCT/short-experiments).
