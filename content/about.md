Hello, my name is Andr√©s!

I'm a software developer, passionate about the web, frontend technologies, and the open source ecosystem.

This is my personal blog. I try to post things relevant to programming, but
sometimes I might post about something else, such as music, videogames, or myself.

This is an effort to produce some content, since I read a lot of things on the Internet
daily, but I almost never write any content of my own. On the other hand, the source for most of my
programming projects is available online, so it sort of balances out.

In any case, I still want to write more technical posts about problems I have solved
or about my favorite technologies, which is why I made this blog in the first place.
